One of the most disheartening things programmers see is a great piece of code that can be reused. This limits the growth of a good application. It also makes it difficult to expand the software capabilities. Companies are then stuck with software that is cannot be expanded. What’s worse is when developers import 3rd party libraries that are often bloated. This slows the program down especially mobile apps. Developers should be encouraged to build their own simple libraries which are more streamlined and are more customized to the companies needs.

As a developer, I’ve learned to take advantage of **Higher Order Functions and Components** in Javascript. This has allowed me to abstract functions that can be customized. I’ve been able to create more complex objects such as tables, navigation bars into **Higher Order Components**. This has allowed me to re-use these components.

# Javascript is a classic functional language

A function should be stable meaning that it given the same arguments, it will return the same values. If the function is stable, it should explicitly return the same values. With Higher Order Functions, it’s the callback function that we have to carefully of

```js
map(), filter(), reduce()
```

are the most common ones.

**Customizable components** allow flexibility for the needs of the application. It also avoids having to import unnecessary members and functions that usually come from 3rd party. This will streamline the software. Since developers wrote the code, it’s best to write your own. It also makes it easier to debug.
