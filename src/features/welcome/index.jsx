          A space enthusiast, whose computer program was launched on a Space
          Shuttle Endeavourâ€™s mission while at UCLA. As a high-end developer, I
          love working in a friendly team environment and making the customers
          happy. With several years of software development, my strong suit is
          integrating new technology to existing web applications while
          respecting the existing legacy code.
